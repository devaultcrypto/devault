# Inflation in DeVault

# Description
---------------------

In DeVault there are 3 sources of inflation

* Coins generated by Mining
* Smart Rewards for coin holders rewarded based on holding for 1 month
* Coins generated each Superblock for Team Budget items

The coins generated by Mining will have an unsual emission curve by cryptocurrency standards. While most coins decrease coin rewards over time and often in huge steps, we believe that this is not the best method.

One reason, is that it heavily rewards the earliest buyers of the coin, especially for unestablished ones where there would not be a lot of demand initially, making it easy for a small amount of people to buy up a large part of the supply cheaply.

To avoid this, we increase the mining block rewards over time from day 1 upto about 1 1/2 years out. This gives plenty of time to get the word out both to users and miners so they can participate before the rewards start declining. After 1 1/2 years, the block reward will be twice the initial reward and start declining gradually.

We use mathematically expresssions to calculate the rewards so that the change gradually and without any large discontinuities
